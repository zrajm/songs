Staffan sent me the MIDI files (*.mid) and I imported them into Rosegarden
(version 1.0) and added missing slurs, fermats and did some corrections on the
beaming before exporting it to Lilypond source. This directory contains the
source files from Staffan, and the saved Rosegarden files, for reference.
