NOW O NOW I NEEDS MUST PART Lyrics

Now, O now, I needs must part,
Parting though I absent mourn
Absence can no joy impart:
Joy once fled cannot return.     (---)
While I live I needs must love,
Love lives not when Hope is gone.
Now at last Despair doth prove,
Love divided loveth none.        (---)

Sad despair doth drive me hence,
This despair unkindness sends.   (---)
If that parting be offence,
It is she which then offends.    (---)

Dear, when I am from thee gone,
Gone are all my joys at once.
I loved thee and thee alone,
In whose love I joyed once.      (---)
And although your sight I leave,
Sight wherein my joys do lie,
Till that death do sense bereave,
Never shall affection die.       (---)

Sad despair doth drive me hence,
This despair unkindness sends.   (---)
If that parting be offence,
It is she which then offends.    (--)

Dear, if I do not return,
Love and I shall die together.   (..)
For my absence never mourn,
Whom you might have joyed ever:  (---)
Part we must though now I die,
Die I do to part with you.
Him Despair doth cause to lie,
Who both liv'd and dieth true    (---)

Sad despair doth drive me hence,
This despair unkindness sends.   (---)
If that parting be offence,
It is she which then offends.    (---)
