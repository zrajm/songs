2006-02-17: Transcribed notes from GIF file, which I downloaded off the 'net
several years ago.

2006-12-13: Upgraded lilypond source from version 2.6.5, to 2.8.8. Added MIDI
file output. Made several prettifications of score (e.g. replaced slurs with
beams, increased spacing in lyrics to improve readability, turned page into
landscape mode).
