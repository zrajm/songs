AUTHOR

    Zrajm C Akfohg <zrajm@klingonska.org> (known among klingonists as
    {maHvatlh}, the founder of "Klingonska Akademien") created these files in
    February 2006, partly to get practice at using the programs involved,
    partly because, well, it's the only Klingon song for which theres notes to
    typeset.

    For more songs in Klingon, take a look at:

    Klingonska Akademien's web site is also a resource not to miss when it
    comes to all things of the Klingon language (there are a lot of
    internationally relevant stuff in English, as well as some more locally
    oriented material presented in Swedish):

SOFTWARE

    created by Lilypond was then imported into Rosegarden4 1.0 and the
    required slurs and ties were added by hand. TiMidity++ 2.13.2 and Eric A.
    Welsh's sound font was used in the MIDI-to-ogg conversion.

FROM THE "KLINGON - FAQ"

2.15 Where can I get the words to the Warrior's Anthem?

(Thanks to Steven Boozer for providing this entry, 5/29/98.)

This is a song from the Star Trek: Klingon CD-ROM from Simon & Schuster
Interactive. It later appeared in the DS9 episode Soldiers of the Empire.

KCD executive producer Keith Halper explains how the song was written:

    "The way that was that Hilary [Bader] wrote something in English, then she
    faxed it out to Mark Okrand. Then Okrand translated it to Klingon and put
    his literal translation below the Klingon verses. The literal translation
    is always skewed a bit, so if you send him `Row, row, row your boat,'
    you'll get back `Propel, propel, propel your craft.'" (STK: 212)

There are a few different formats.

    * Original Lyrics

Original Lyrics (by Hilary Bader)

    Hear! Sons of Kahless.
    Hear! Daughters too.
    The blood of battle washes clean
    The Warrior brave and true.
    We fight, we love, and then we kill.
    Our lives burn short and bright,
    Then we die with honor and join our fathers in the Black Fleet where
    we battle forever, battling on through the Eternal fight.

Okrand's Translation

    Qoy qeylIs puqloD.
    Qoy puqbe'pu'.
    yoHbogh matlhbogh je SuvwI'
    Say'moHchu' may' 'Iw.
    maSuv manong 'ej maHoHchu'.
    nI'be' yInmaj 'ach wovqu'.
    batlh maHeghbej 'ej yo' qIjDaq vavpu'ma' DImuv.
    pa' reH maSuvtaHqu'.
    mamevQo'. maSuvtaH. ma'ov.

Okrand's literal back translation:

    Hear! sons of Kahless.
    Hear! daughters.
    The battle blood perfectly cleans the warrior who is brave and loyal.
    We fight, we're passionate, and we kill perfectly.
    Our lives are not long, but they're very bright.
    We certainly die, and we join our fathers in the Black Fleet.
    There we always really continue fighting.
    We won't stop. We continue fighting. We compete.
