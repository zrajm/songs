Changes to Bach chorals (and other notes):

    o Additional left margin to allow for holes for folder placement.
      (how to make this work for even/odd pages when printing double sided? --
      wide margin on both sides?)

        % A4: is 210×297 mm
        % Allow for holes in left margin
        %leftmargin      = 20\mm
        %FIXME:
        %#(define linewidth (- (- (* 21 cm) (* 2 cm)) (* 1 cm))) % A4 is 21 cm wide
        %%rightmargin    =  ??   % not implemented in Lilypond 2.6.x

    o Staff size of 16 is *too small*. Looks good, but is needlessly difficult
      to use in practice. Maybe 18 is better? -- Is it possible to place
      lyrics closer to the notes though? Also, can multiple lyrics to same
      notes, could they be placed closer together to allow for at three
      systems on each page, even when there is two verses present?

    o Add a left arrow below lowest system on page to indicate where a page
      break occurs. (It is not always easy to anticipate, esp. not when
      singing for the first time.)

    o Number all measures for easier reference.



in Makefile:
  o MIDI renamer should compare midi with any previousy existing -- so that we
    don't need to regenerate all oggs etc if sound outout from lilypond is
    identical to any previous compile

  o Option to disable piano part? (or generate files both with and without
    it? = *many* files!)

  o Targets for building jpeg files.

  o Targets for building mixes of various kinds: alto+soprano+piano, alto+bass
    etc. (Can this be done dynamically somehow?)

FIXME: rgly2ly

re-beaming should be able to cope with:

    [ a8. bes16 ] c'8[ g ] a4\fermata
    bachkoral_40.ly:287:41: error: errors found, ignoring music expression

    and chords (which, apparently may look like this "< a b > 2.")

    in Choral 56, there's a problem in the soprano voice with something that
    may have looked like this in the Rosegarden exported original:

      [ a'8 bes'16 ( c'' ) ]


move all Staff.Instrument inside Voice context


\midi output (but *only* midi) should expand all repeats (unfold-repeats or
\unfoldRepeats) during processing




When exporting to Lilypond from Rosegarden the followng is written (after
apropriate convert-ly) `ais _#'(italic "b")' this is better expressed in
lilypond 2.6.x as `ais ^\markup\flat', but should be translated into a simle
"bes", actually. (This way any wrongly flattened, or sharpened notes could be
corrected in Rosegarden, and this change could be retained.)
