HISTORY

28 November 2006: Converted source from lilypond 2.6 to 2.8 format.

17 May 2006: Copied rhythm patterns and syncronized the three voices with
respect to each other. Also tested a program called `midingsolo', and used it
to transcribe the melody of the first voice from the melody I've got in my
head. (I think I have it on cassette somewhere, but I don't have a cassette
player..) Many thanks to Jennifer Saverstam Lydecker for inspiration.
